// 3.Build a 'Guess the Song' game like Spotify — the program randomly picks a song name from a list and asks the user to guess it. Use a do-while loop so the user can keep guessing until they get it right.<br><br><em><strong>Constraint:</strong> Use at least 3 song names of your choice.</em>

    // Pick a random index between 0 and 2
    int randomIndex = rand() % 3; 
    
    // Variables for correct song and user's guess
    char correctSong[20];
