// 4. Simulate a BookMyShow ticket booking by creating a Ticket class that prints 'Saving your ticket...' in its destructor. Create and delete a Ticket object to demonstrate the destructor lifecycle.<br><br><em><strong>Hint:</strong> Use the __del__ method (Python) or ~Ticket() (C++) to define the destructor.</em>
